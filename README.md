# Minimum JS

Are you developing a large project and you're lacking a good front-end developer? Then Minimum JS is the answer to all your prayers! 

This library helps you find your way out of ALL the situations that only a good front-end developer could get you through. From using top notch libraries to recoding some jquery core functionalities.

It's still under alpha, so if you find a bug then report it to the creator.

#Usage
  minimum(options);
  
  options.mode can be 'silent' or 'verbose'
  
  Example: 
  ```
  minimum({mode: 'silent'});
  ```
  
  And that's it! Minimum will do the rest of the work for you!
